  <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
  <p>
    This privacy policy (&quot;Policy&quot;) describes how the personally
    identifiable information (&quot;Personal Information&quot;) you may provide
    in the &quot;Super Squad&quot; mobile application (&quot;Mobile
    Application&quot; or &quot;Service&quot;) and any of its related products
    and services (collectively, &quot;Services&quot;) is collected, protected
    and used. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use
    of your Personal Information and how you can access and update this
    information. This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you
    (&quot;User&quot;, &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;) and Metazapp
    Solutions Pvt Ltd (&quot;Metazapp Solutions Pvt Ltd&quot;, &quot;we&quot;,
    &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;). By accessing and using the Mobile
    Application and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood,
    and agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy. This Policy does not
    apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to
    individuals that we do not employ or manage.
  </p>
  <h2>Automatic collection of information</h2>
  <p>
    Our top priority is customer data security and, as such, we exercise the no
    logs policy. We may process only minimal user data, only as much as it is
    absolutely necessary to maintain the Mobile Application and Services.
    Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases
    of abuse and establish statistical information regarding the usage of the
    Mobile Application and Services. This statistical information is not
    otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user
    of the system.
  </p>
  <h2>Collection of personal information</h2>
  <p>
    You can access and use the Mobile Application and Services without telling
    us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify
    you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use
    some of the features in the Mobile Application, you may be asked to provide
    certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail address). We
    receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you
    create an account, publish content, or fill any online forms in the Mobile
    Application. When required, this information may include the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Personal details such as name, country of residence, etc.</li>
    <li>Contact information such as email address, address, etc.</li>
    <li>Account details such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc.</li>
    <li>Proof of identity such as photocopy of a government ID.</li>
    <li>Payment information such as credit card details, bank details, etc.</li>
    <li>
      Certain features on the mobile device such as contacts, calendar, gallery,
      etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      Any other materials you willingly submit to us such as articles, images,
      feedback, etc.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Some of the information we collect is directly from you via the Mobile
    Application and Services. However, we may also collect Personal Information
    about you from other sources such as public databases, social media
    platforms, third-party data providers, and our joint marketing partners.
    Personal Information we collect from other sources may include demographic
    information, such as age and gender, device information, such as IP
    addresses, location, such as city and state, and online behavioral data,
    such as information about your use of social media websites, page view
    information and search results and links. You can choose not to provide us
    with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take
    advantage of some of the features in the Mobile Application. Users who are
    uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.
  </p>
  <h2>Use and processing of collected information</h2>
  <p>
    In order to make the Mobile Application and Services available to you, or to
    meet a legal obligation, we may need to collect and use certain Personal
    Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may
    not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of
    the information we collect from you may be used for the following purposes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create and manage user accounts</li>
    <li>Fulfill and manage orders</li>
    <li>Send administrative information</li>
    <li>Send marketing and promotional communications</li>
    <li>Respond to inquiries and offer support</li>
    <li>Request user feedback</li>
    <li>Improve user experience</li>
    <li>Post customer testimonials</li>
    <li>Administer prize draws and competitions</li>
    <li>Enforce terms and conditions and policies</li>
    <li>Protect from abuse and malicious users</li>
    <li>Respond to legal requests and prevent harm</li>
    <li>Run and operate the Mobile Application and Services</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the
    Mobile Application and Services, where you are located in the world and if
    one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or
    more specific purposes; this, however, does not apply, whenever the
    processing of Personal Information is subject to European data protection
    law; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of an
    agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii)
    processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you
    are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the
    public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v)
    processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued
    by us or by a third party.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information
    until you object to such processing (by opting out), without having to rely
    on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. In any case, we
    will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the
    processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information
    is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to
    enter into a contract.
  </p>
  <h2>Managing information</h2>
  <p>
    You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you. The
    Personal Information you can delete may change as the Mobile Application and
    Services change. When you delete Personal Information, however, we may
    maintain a copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our records for the
    duration necessary to comply with our obligations to our affiliates and
    partners, and for the purposes described below.
  </p>
  <h2>Disclosure of information</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any
    transaction or provide any service you have requested, we may share your
    information with your consent with our trusted third parties that work with
    us, any other affiliates and subsidiaries we rely upon to assist in the
    operation of the Mobile Application and Services available to you. We do not
    share Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties. These service
    providers are not authorized to use or disclose your information except as
    necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal
    requirements. We may share your Personal Information for these purposes only
    with third parties whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who
    agree to abide by our policies with respect to Personal Information. These
    third parties are given Personal Information they need only in order to
    perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or
    disclose Personal Information for their own marketing or other purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or receive if
    required or permitted by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar
    legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is
    necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of
    others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
  </p>
  <h2>Retention of information</h2>
  <p>
    We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to
    comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our
    agreements unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
    We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal
    Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would
    identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal
    Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to
    erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot
    be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.
  </p>
  <h2>The rights of users</h2>
  <p>
    You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us.
    In particular, you have the right to do the following: (i) you have the
    right to withdraw consent where you have previously given your consent to
    the processing of your information; (ii) you have the right to object to the
    processing of your information if the processing is carried out on a legal
    basis other than consent; (iii) you have the right to learn if information
    is being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the
    processing and obtain a copy of the information undergoing processing; (iv)
    you have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it
    to be updated or corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain
    circumstances, to restrict the processing of your information, in which
    case, we will not process your information for any purpose other than
    storing it; (vi) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain
    the erasure of your Personal Information from us; (vii) you have the right
    to receive your information in a structured, commonly used and machine
    readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to
    another controller without any hindrance. This provision is applicable
    provided that your information is processed by automated means and that the
    processing is based on your consent, on a contract which you are part of or
    on pre-contractual obligations thereof.
  </p>
  <h2>Privacy of children</h2>
  <p>
    We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the
    age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any Personal
    Information through the Mobile Application and Services. We encourage
    parents and legal guardians to monitor their children&#39;s Internet usage
    and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to
    provide Personal Information through the Mobile Application and Services
    without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under
    the age of 18 has provided Personal Information to us through the Mobile
    Application and Services, please contact us. You must also be old enough to
    consent to the processing of your Personal Information in your country (in
    some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your
    behalf).
  </p>
  <h2>Advertisements</h2>
  <p>
    We may permit certain third party companies to help us tailor advertising
    that we think may be of interest to users and to collect and use other data
    about user activities in the Mobile Application. These companies may deliver
    ads that might place cookies and otherwise track user behavior.
  </p>
  <h2>Affiliates</h2>
  <p>
    We may disclose information about you to our affiliates for the purpose of
    being able to offer you related or additional products and services. Any
    information relating to you that we provide to our affiliates will be
    treated by those affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Policy.
  </p>
  <h2>Email marketing</h2>
  <p>
    We offer electronic newsletters to which you may voluntarily subscribe at
    any time. We are committed to keeping your e-mail address confidential and
    will not disclose your email address to any third parties except as allowed
    in the information use and processing section or for the purposes of
    utilizing a third party provider to send such emails. We will maintain the
    information sent via e-mail in accordance with applicable laws and
    regulations.
  </p>
  <p>
    In compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act, all e-mails sent from us will clearly
    state who the e-mail is from and provide clear information on how to contact
    the sender.
  </p>
  <h2>Links to other resources</h2>
  <p>
    The Mobile Application and Services contain links to other resources that
    are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not
    responsible for the privacy practices of such other resources or third
    parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Mobile Application
    and Services and to read the privacy statements of each and every resource
    that may collect Personal Information.
  </p>
  <h2>Information security</h2>
  <p>
    We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled,
    secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
    We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in
    an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and
    disclosure of Personal Information in its control and custody. However, no
    data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed.
    Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you
    acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of the
    Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity, and
    privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and the
    Mobile Application and Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such
    information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third
    party, despite best efforts.
  </p>
  <h2>Data breach</h2>
  <p>
    In the event we become aware that the security of the Mobile Application and
    Services has been compromised or users Personal Information has been
    disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity,
    including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the
    right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited
    to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation
    with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will
    make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that
    there is a reasonable risk of harm to the user as a result of the breach or
    if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do, we will send you an
    email, mail you a letter.
  </p>
  <h2>Changes and amendments</h2>
  <p>
    We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms relating to the
    Mobile Application and Services from time to time in our discretion and will
    notify you of any material changes to the way in which we treat Personal
    Information. When we do, we will send you an email to notify you. We may
    also provide notice to you in other ways in our discretion, such as through
    contact information you have provided. Any updated version of this Policy
    will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Policy unless
    otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Mobile Application and
    Services after the effective date of the revised Policy (or such other act
    specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those changes.
    However, we will not, without your consent, use your Personal Information in
    a manner materially different than what was stated at the time your Personal
    Information was collected.
