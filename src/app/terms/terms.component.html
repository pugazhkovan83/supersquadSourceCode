  <h1>DMCA policy</h1>
  <p>
    This Digital Millennium Copyright Act policy (&quot;Policy&quot;) applies to
    the &quot;Super Squad&quot; mobile application (&quot;Mobile
    Application&quot; or &quot;Service&quot;) and any of its related products
    and services (collectively, &quot;Services&quot;) and outlines how Metazapp
    Solutions Pvt Ltd (&quot;Metazapp Solutions Pvt Ltd&quot;, &quot;we&quot;,
    &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;) addresses copyright infringement
    notifications and how you (&quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;) may submit a
    copyright infringement complaint.
  </p>
  <p>
    Protection of intellectual property is of utmost importance to us and we ask
    our users and their authorized agents to do the same. It is our policy to
    expeditiously respond to clear notifications of alleged copyright
    infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright
    Act (&quot;DMCA&quot;) of 1998, the text of which can be found at the U.S.

  </p>
  <h2>What to consider before submitting a copyright complaint</h2>
  <p>
    Before submitting a copyright complaint to us, consider whether the use
    could be considered fair use. Fair use states that brief excerpts of
    copyrighted material may, under certain circumstances, be quoted verbatim
    for purposes such as criticism, news reporting, teaching, and research,
    without the need for permission from or payment to the copyright holder. If
    you have considered fair use, and you still wish to continue with a
    copyright complaint, you may want to first reach out to the user in question
    to see if you can resolve the matter directly with the user.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note that under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), you may be liable for any
    damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by us or our users, if
    you knowingly misrepresent that the material or activity is infringing. If
    you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in fact infringing,
    you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a notification with us.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may, at our discretion or as required by law, share a copy of your
    notification or counter-notification with third parties. This may include
    sharing the information with the account holder engaged in the allegedly
    infringing activity or for publication. If you are concerned about your
    information being forwarded, you may wish to
    <a

      target="_blank"
      >hire an agent</a
    >
    to report infringing material for you.
  </p>
  <h2>Notifications of infringement</h2>
  <p>
    If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and you believe that any
    material available on our Services infringes your copyrights, then you may
    submit a written copyright infringement notification
    (&quot;Notification&quot;) using the contact details below pursuant to the
    DMCA by providing us with the following information:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Identification of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed,

      may provide a representative list of the copyrighted works that you claim
      have been infringed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Identification of the infringing material and information you claim is
      infringing (or the subject of infringing activity), including at a
      minimum, if applicable, the URL or URLs of the web pages where the
      allegedly infringing material may be found.
    </li>
    <li>
      Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an
      address, telephone number, and, if available, an e-mail address.
    </li>
    <li>
      A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in
      the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, the
      copyright owner&#39;s agent, or the law.
    </li>
    <li>
      A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and
      under penalty of perjury that you are authorized to act on behalf of the
      owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
    </li>
    <li>
      A physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will suffice) of
      the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    All such Notifications must comply with the DMCA requirements. You may refer
    to a

    >
    or other similar services to avoid making mistake and ensure compliance of
    your Notification.
  </p>
  <p>
    Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process. Your
    complaint will be reviewed for accuracy, validity, and completeness. If your
    complaint has satisfied these requirements, our response may include the
    removal or restriction of access to allegedly infringing material as well as
    a permanent termination of repeat infringers’ accounts.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we remove or restrict access to materials or terminate an account in
    response to a Notification of alleged infringement, we will make a good
    faith effort to contact the affected user with information concerning the
    removal or restriction of access, which may include a full copy of your
    Notification (including your name, address, phone, and email address), along
    with instructions for filing a counter-notification.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any portion of this
    Policy, Metazapp Solutions Pvt Ltd reserves the right to take no action upon
    receipt of a DMCA copyright infringement notification if it fails to comply
    with all the requirements of the DMCA for such notifications.
  </p>
  <h2>Counter-notifications</h2>
  <p>
    A user who receives a copyright infringement Notification may make a
    counter-Notification pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the US
    Copyright Act. If you receive a copyright infringement Notification, it
    means that the material described in the Notification has been removed from
